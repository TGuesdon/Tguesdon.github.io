                    <h2>What is it ?</h2>
                    <p>
                        This project allows twitch streamers to take part in a quizz with their viewers without any software installation on viewer AND streamer side.
                        To achieve this, I used a NodeJS server running an Angular application and a twitch bot using Tmi.JS. 
                        The twitch bot read the streamer irc channel and communicates any answer to the quizz to the Angular application, which then compare the answer to the database, hosted on Firebase.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There is currently two game mode, the first which is a classic quizz with viewers earning points when they get the right answer, 
                        and the second where the goal is to get the closest guess from the answer.
                        Everyone can propose new questions by using a form accessible on the website. There is around 1000 (french) questions right now.
                        I also added a "premium" user functionnality, which allows users to create their own categories for 4$.
                        This was added to help me pay the hosting server.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How to use it ?</h2>

                    <p>
                        It is really simple, you only have to enter your twitch username, and then stream the website to your viewers.
                        To answer, they have to type !g the_answer. You can choose which categories you want to play with and how much time the viewers have to answer.
                    </p>

                    <div class="tg_img_block">
                        <img class="tg_project_image" src="../../assets/twitch-quizz/index.PNG"/>
                        <span class="tg_project_image_caption">Home screen</span>
                    </div>

                    <h2>How was it made ?</h2>

                    <p>
                        The website works thanks to 3 parts :
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The Database : A Firebase project which contains all the datas.</li>
                        <li>The Server : A NodeJS server which serve the client's web files and host a twitch bot.</li>
                        <li>The Client : An Angular client, which compare inputs from the twitch bot to the answer.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Firebase Database</h3>

                    <p>
                        This is a classic firebase project, with realtime database used to store data in JSON format and authentification to allow account management on the client.
                        The security of a realtime database is different than a classic SQL Database, as the access are accessible to everyone using the client.
                        To be sure that my data is secure, I use realtime databasse access rules which allows me to specify rights on each modification. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>NodeJS Server</h3>

                    <p>
                        The NodeJS server has two roles. It serves the web files to the client using express as any node js server. 
                        Once the server is running, I use socket.io to communicate with the client, and run a twitch bot which connect to the twitch irc channel asked by the client.
                        The bot then send any command typed in the chat to the client.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Angular Client</h3>

                    <p>
                        The Angular client is the biggest part of this application. It can be divided into two parts : the back-office and the game in itself.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>The Game part</h4>

                    <p>
                        This part contains everything needed to play the game. It starts with the 'twitch-linker' page (which is the home landing page of the website), which will ask the server to connect to the provided twitch channel's irc chat.
                        The first interaction with firebase database occurs just after a successful connection, when the user has to chose on which categories he will play.
                        Finally, there is the gameloop, on which inputs coming from the twitch chat bot (running on the nodeJS server) are compared to the current question. 
                        A scoreboard and controls to grant bonus or malus are included in the game.
                    </p>

                    <h4>The Back-office</h4>

                    <p>
                        This part allows administrators to manage content of the quizz. There is only one pages accessible to everyone, which is the one used to submit new questions.
                        For every other pages of the back-office, I used Angular Material to develop a clean and ergonomic way of managing our content.
                        My main issue was to display a lot of questions (1128 as of 03/11/2021) in a table without too much loading or lags when doing updates.
                        I chose to display a table for each category of question, which is encapsulated in a tab Material module, and to further improve performance I added pagination to these tables.
                        This allows ergonomic manipulation and good performances. The table contains controls to edit or remove any question.
                    </p>

                    <div class="tg_img_block">
                        <img class="tg_project_image" src="../../assets/twitch-quizz/dashboard.PNG"/>
                        <span class="tg_project_image_caption">Dashboard</span>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        I also included a statistics screen that allows me to see who used the website and how much participation they got from their twitch chat.
                    </p>
